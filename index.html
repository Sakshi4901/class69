		<p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you�耱l miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p> </div>
